# Installing Virtual Box

1. Open up virtual box and click new. Where it says "Name" put "Ubuntu 18.04" then click next.
2. Memory size is the amount of ram the virtual enviornment can use  while open. The bare minimum it needs is 1 gigbyte, but I reccommend setting it as 4. You can customize it depending how strong your desktop or laptop is.
3. Don't change anything else while setting up the new virtual enviornment until it ask for storage size, for simplicity sake.
4. Recommended storage size for the virtual machine is 30 gigabytes.
5. Once you are done click the settings button ontop of the virtual box main page and go to system, then processor, and change the amount of processors to 2. This will greatly affect the speed so make sure you do this.
6. Go to network and set "Attached to:" to Bridged adapter and this will use the wifi you are already connected to.  
7. Press okay and start your virtual machine.
8. Click on the folder Icon and locate your ubuntu desktop download. 
9. Ubuntu is now setting up and it will ask you to either try or install Ubuntu. Click on install and you're all set to use Ubuntu
10. It will say when installing Ubuntu that it will delete all other files, but that is not the case.
